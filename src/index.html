            <p>
                Running is very important for health. 
                That is why at EVU-Landia we are very interested in everyone running, at least once a week. 
                Thanks to the FH St. Pölten  <a class="highlight" title="FH St. Pölten" href="https://www.fhstp.ac.at/de/"> FH St. Pölten </a>
                we have been able to make 65% of people in St. Pölten exercise more. 
                That's why we want to invite you to do one of our monthly events.
            </p>
            <p>
                These events consist of running between 5 and 10 km, there are different groups, and we help you reach your goals,
                 you can see these events as the first steps towards running a half marathon one day. You can find our next Event on our <a title="Event Dates" href="event_dates.html"> &#128197; </a>.
